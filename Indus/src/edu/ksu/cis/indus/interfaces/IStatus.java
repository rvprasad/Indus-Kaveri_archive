 * This class is used to indicate the status of an object before dispatching any methods on it.  The intent of this interface

 * in a stable state to do so.  Hence, it is adviced that information-providing interfaces inherit this interface.  On a
 * general note,  this interface can be used in situations where a support to query status is required.
