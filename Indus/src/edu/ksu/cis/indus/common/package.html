This package contains classes which are common to Indus independent of the nature of their usage. In other words it contains 
classes which are generic to implementation of analyses.  They provide graph representations and 
various other structures such as Pairs, Triples, WorkBag, etc., required during graph processing or graph-based 
processing in analyses, and soot-related classes common to analyses.  Basically anything that can be used across 
various sub-projects boil up into this package.
