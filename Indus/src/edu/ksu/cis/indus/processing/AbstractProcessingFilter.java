   ChangeLog:
   $Log$
   Revision 1.2  2003/11/30 00:20:41  venku
   - documentation.
   Revision 1.1  2003/11/30 00:10:17  venku
   - Major refactoring:
     ProcessingController is more based on the sort it controls.
     The filtering of class is another concern with it's own
     branch in the inheritance tree.  So, the user can tune the
     controller with a filter independent of the sort of processors.
