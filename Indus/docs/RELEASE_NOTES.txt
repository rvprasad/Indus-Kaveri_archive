	- Minor bug fixes to Tools api classes.


Version 0.2
------------
	- All xmlizers use classes from xmlenc library to generate xml documents.
	- Lots of refactoring.
	- Reachability optimization in graphs.
	- A slew of classes for filtered viewing of java collections framework class instances.


Version 0.1
-----------
This is (hopefully) a stable release of version 0.1a.  One notable change is that we have decided to use Soot 2.1.0 for
Indus.  This is because there were some changes in Soot pertaining to control flow graphs which were not decided at the time
of this release.  As we do not know when these changes in Soot will stabilize we advice the users to use Soot 2.1.0 only.

We have introduced a new module, tokens, to manage values/tokens in the flow analyses.


Version 0.1a
--------------
This is the first release of Indus subproject of Indus.  This modules captures the interfaces and implementation common to
other modules in Indus.  Please refer to the user guide and the javadocs for more information.  Users at this point should not
be deal with this module but rather should require it to use the slicer and the staticanalyses modules.
