   - fixed documentation errors.
   Revision 1.1  2003/11/06 05:15:07  venku
   - Refactoring, Refactoring, Refactoring.
   - Generalized the processing controller to be available
     in Indus as it may be useful outside static anlaysis. This
     meant moving IProcessor, Context, and ProcessingController.
   - ripple effect of the above changes was large.
   Revision 1.3  2003/09/28 03:08:03  venku
   - I don't know.  cvs indicates that there are no differences,
     but yet says it is out of sync.

   Revision 1.1  2003/08/07 06:42:16  venku
   Major:
    - Moved the package under indus umbrella.
    - Renamed isEmpty() to hasWork() in IWorkBag.
