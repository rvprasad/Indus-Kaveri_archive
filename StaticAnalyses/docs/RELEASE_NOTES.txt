Version 0.2
-------------
	- All xmlizers use classes from xmlenc library to generate xml documents.


Version 0.2a
-------------
	- Memory/Performance optimizations in EquivalenceClassBasedEscapeAnalysis.


Version 0.1
------------
This is (hopefully) a stable release of version 0.1a.  One notable change is that we have decided to use Soot 2.1.0 for
Indus.  This is because there were some changes in Soot pertaining to control flow graphs which were not decided at the time
of this release.  As we do not know when these changes in Soot will stabilize we advice the users to use Soot 2.1.0 only.

We have switched over to a new module to manage values in the flow analyses.  This module is available in Indus module.


Version 0.1a
--------------
This is the first release of StaticAnalyses subproject of Indus.  This module provides implementation of a flow analysis
framework, object flow anlaysis, escape analysis, and a slew of dependence analyses.  Please refer to the user guide and java
docs for more information.  

In this release, the following implementations do not work.
	Exit Control dependence (edu.ksu.cis.indus.staticanalyses.dependency.ExitControlDA)
	Divergence dependence (edu.ksu.cis.indus.staticanalyses.dependency.DivergenceDA)
	Safe Lock Analysis (edu.ksu.cis.indus.staticanalyses.concurrence.SafeLockAnalysis)
	
Ruf's escape analysis will not be supported in the future, so, please refrain from using it or use it at your own risk.
Likewise, please refrain from using Driver classes as these are not intended for the users and also it is planned to delete
them by v1.0.
