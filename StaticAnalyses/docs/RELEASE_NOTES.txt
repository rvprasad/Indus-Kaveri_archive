Version 0.6
----------------
	- Refactored call graph calculation logic.
	- Added implementations of Class Hierarchy Analysis (CHA) based and Rapid Type Analysis (RTA) based call graph 
	  construction. [API BREAKING CHANGE]
	- Added support to retrieve field reading/writing thread information from EquivalenceClassBasedEscapeAnalysis.
	

Version 0.5
------------
    - Added escape information preserving calling context retriever.
    - Added Non-termination insensitive control dependence and pure inter-procedural divergence dependence analysis.
	- Added support to dynamically update relation between types and tokens in the token management framework.
	- Incorporated SCC-based optimizations into flow analysis framework.
	- Optimized certain graph algorithms.
	- Added a side-effect analysis. 
	- Added an atomicity analysis.  This supports detection of atomic regions and "independent"/atomic statements.
	- Support for tracking thread "escape" information across method boundaries.
	- Fixed bugs in Reference-based DA and OFAXMLizer.
	- Added analysis to calculate static field-based use-def info.
	- Added support to generate thread-locality based calling context.
	- Code refactoring.

Version 0.4
------------
	- Feature requests 426.
	- Class file and Sources are now v1.4 compatible.


Version 0.3
------------
	- Implemented SafeLock Analysis.
	- Refactored Synchronization dependence analysis into a simple dependence analysis and a general purpose
	  Monitor Analysis.
	- Bugfixes in Escape analysis, Interference dependence analysis, Reference Based Data Dependence analysis
	  and EquivalenceClass-based Escape Analysis.
	- Optimizations in AliasedUseDefInfov2.
	- Optimized version of Local Use Def analysis (LocalUseDefInfov2).
	- Provided a helper class to calculate indirect dependence based on direct dependence information.
	- Catered bug reports 395.
	- Deleted deprecated Driver classes along with Ruf's Escape analysis.


Version 0.2
------------
	- Memory/Performance optimizations and bug fixes in EquivalenceClassBasedEscapeAnalysis.
	- All xmlizers use classes from xmlenc library to generate xml documents.
	- Implemented Indirect and Direct Entry Control dependence.
	- Added new options to OFA and CallGraph CLI classes.
	- Added a new implementation of Use-Def Analysis for method locals.
	- Implemented Divergence dependence (edu.ksu.cis.indus.staticanalyses.dependency.DivergenceDA)
	- Implemented Exit Control dependence (edu.ksu.cis.indus.staticanalyses.dependency.ExitControlDA)
	

Version 0.1
------------
This is (hopefully) a stable release of version 0.1a.  One notable change is that we have decided to use Soot 2.1.0 for
Indus.  This is because there were some changes in Soot pertaining to control flow graphs which were not decided at 
the time of this release.  As we do not know when these changes in Soot will stabilize we advice the users to use 
Soot 2.1.0 only.

We have switched over to a new module to manage values in the flow analyses.  This module is available in Indus 
module.


Version 0.1a
--------------
This is the first release of StaticAnalyses subproject of Indus.  This module provides implementation of a flow analysis
framework, object flow anlaysis, escape analysis, and a slew of dependence analyses.  Please refer to the user guide 
and java docs for more information.  

In this release, the following implementations do not work.
	Exit Control dependence (edu.ksu.cis.indus.staticanalyses.dependency.ExitControlDA)
	Divergence dependence (edu.ksu.cis.indus.staticanalyses.dependency.DivergenceDA)
	Safe Lock Analysis (edu.ksu.cis.indus.staticanalyses.concurence.SafeLockAnalysis)
	
Ruf's escape analysis will not be supported in the future, so, please refrain from using it or use it at your own risk.
Likewise, please refrain from using Driver classes as these are not intended for the users and also it is planned to delete
them by v1.0.
