<p>This package contains the classes that implement Object Flow Analysis as described in "Object-flow analysis for
	  optimization of finite state models of Java programs".  It contains classes which are mode independent.  To use the
	  analysis, an instance of Analyzer needs to be instantiated and analyze() method needs to be executed on it.</p>
<p>This package also contains classes that can be used to generate XML documents containing the object flow 
	  analysis information.</p>
