<p>This package contains classes that use and process information available from object flow analysis  to provide 
	higher level information about the system such as call graph and threaded call graph.  The classes in this
	package are independent of any particular implementation of object flow analysis.</p>
<p>This package also contains classes that can be used to generate XML documents containing the call graph 
information.</p>
