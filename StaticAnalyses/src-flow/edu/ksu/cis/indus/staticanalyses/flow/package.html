<p>This package contains the classes and interface required to realize constraint-based style of flow analysis.  It also
	  contains abstract implementations for some of the interfaces.  All analyses should extend the interfaces or abstract
	  classes.  It has been tried to enforce that the analyses use the operations of objects rather than directly accessing
	  the attributes to set/get values.  This enables the implementation of the core framework to change independent of the
	  analyses implemented.</p>
<p>All reference parameters are non-null unless specified otherwise.</p>
<p>All exceptions which are not thrown are logged at WARN level.</p>
