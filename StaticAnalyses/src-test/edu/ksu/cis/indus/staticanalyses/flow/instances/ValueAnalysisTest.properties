# The data in this file is structured.
# It should have one entry of name "configs" which should be a space separated list of configuration names.
# Each specified configuration should have the 3 entries starting with the configuration name.
#
# If the user wants the jimple dumped as XML, then the location where jimple.xml should be created can be 
# specified per configuration via configName.dumpJimpleDir property.   If this property is unspecified, jimple is
# not dumped as XML.
#
# Example
#
# configs=config1
# config1.xmlTestDir=/tmp/todaystesting/
# config1.xmlControlDir=/tmp/testing/
# config1.classNames=a b c d
# config1.classpath=.
# config1.jimpleXMLDumpDir=/tmp/dump
