<p>This package contains classes that provide escape information and any other information that can be obtained by extending 
escape analysis.  Two such extensions are to used to  interference and ready dependence information.</p>
<p>If unspecified, then all reference parameters can be null.</p>
<h3>TODO:</h3>

<li>Two values are declared as shared in EquivalenceClassBasedAnalysis if they escape.  However, this is untrue and can be 
addressed by using symbols as done to improve ready dependence information.</li>
