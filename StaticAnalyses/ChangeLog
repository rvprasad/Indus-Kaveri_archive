	* src-dependence/edu/ksu/cis/indus/staticanalyses/dependency/DivergenceDA.java: Although divergence is captured in non-
	termination sensitive control dependence, it's mixed with control dependence.  Hence, it is best to calculate divergence 
	dependence separately.  This seems like an overhead, but it is useful in program comprehension.  Hence, I reverted to the
	old code base of both intra- and inter-procedural flavour.
		I also changed the manner in which new instances of this class wer created.	
	
	* src-dependence/edu/ksu/cis/indus/staticanalyses/dependency/InterProceduralDivergenceDA.java: Created a pure 
	Interprocedural divergence dependence analysis.
		I also changed the manner in which new instances of this class wer created.
	
	* src-dependence/edu/ksu/cis/indus/staticanalyses/dependency/NonTerminationInsensitiveEntryControlDA.java: Added support
	to toggle between direct	and indirect version of non-termination sensitive control dependence used to calculate non-termination
	insensitive control dependence.

	* src-xml/edu/ksu/cis/indus/staticanalyses/dependency/DependencyXMLizerCLI.java: Ripple effect from changes to 
	DivergenceDA.java.
	
	* src-dependence/edu/ksu/cis/indus/staticanalyses/dependency/DivergenceDA.java: Trimmed the DivergenceDA to calculate
	simple inter-procedural Divergence dependence.  This can be used in conjunction with non-termination-sensitive control 
	dependence to arrive at intra- plus inter-procedural divergence dependence information.
