<p>This package contains classes that provide program dependence information that can be used in applications such 
as program slicing.  Please refer to <a http://www.cis.ksu.edu/santos/papers/technicalReports.html">A Formal  Study of Slicing 
for Multi-threaded Program with JVM Concurrency Primitives"</a> for definition of the dependences.</p>
<p>If unspecified, then all reference parameters can be null.</p>
<p>This package also contains classes that can be used to generate XML documents containing the dependence 
information.</p>
