	* src/edu/ksu/cis/indus/slicer/SlicingEngine.java: Added logic to track calling contexts.

	* auxiliary/slicerConfig.xsd, 
	  auxiliary/slicerConfig_JiBXBinding.xml: 
	  src/edu/ksu/cis/indus/tools/slicer/SlicerConfiguration.java: 
	  	Support to control inter-procedural-ness of Ready dependence.
	
	* src/edu/ksu/cis/indus/tools/slicer/criteria/generators/StaticSliceCriteriaGenerator.java: The criteria were not being 
	contextualized. FIXED.
	
	* src/edu/ksu/cis/indus/tools/slicer/SlicerConfigurator.java (setupReadyDepUI):  Altered layout.
	Added tool tips to all graphical entities.	
	
	* src/edu/ksu/cis/indus/toolkits/bandera/SlicerTool.java: Ripple effect of changes to concerned classes.
	
	* src/edu/ksu/cis/indus/slicer/DependenceExtractor.java: Ripple effect of converting ready dependence info pertaining to ready 
		dependence relating synchronized methods to be non-statement based and of the above changes.
		
	* edu.ksu.cis.indus.slicer:
		Renamed classes as given below.
			AbstractSliceCriterion -> AbstractProgramPointLevelSliceCriterion
			SliceStmt -> StmtLevelSliceCriterion
			SliceExpr -> ExprLevelSliceCriterion
		Introduced a new class to represent method level slice criterion - MethodLevelSliceCriterion.
		Methods in above classes were renamed appropritately.
		SlicingEngine was modified to calculate slice based on method level slice criterion.
		BackwardSlicingPart, ForwardSlicingPart, and SliceCriteriaFactory had ripple effects.

	  src/edu/ksu/cis/indus/tools/slicer/SlicerConfigurator.java, 
	  src/edu/ksu/cis/indus/tools/slicer/SlicerConfiguration.java, : 
	  	Added support to control 
		- inter-procedural v/s intra-procedural v/s inter-and-intra-procedural diveregence deps
		- synchronization dependence
		- non-termination sensitive and insensitive control dependence.
