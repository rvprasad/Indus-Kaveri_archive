Version 0.6.4
-----------------
	- Minor bug fixes and performance improvements.
	- Feature Request: #576.

Version 0.6.3
-----------------
	- Bug fix pertaining to property-aware slicing.
	- Enabled support to limit the length of calling context during property-aware slicing.

Verion 0.6.1
----------------
	- Added a new optimization that (tries) prunes sliced class hierarchy to get rid of empty classes and methods.
	- The format of the slicer's configuration changed yet again. (sorry)

Version 0.6
----------------
	- Forward slices can now be configured to consider both exit control dependence and entry control dependence.
	- Support to consider various levels of interprocedural exception flow sensitive control dependence during slicing.
	- Feature request #616, #608.
	- Bug fixes.
	- Enabled space optimization of executable slice.
	- Used new calling context retrievers in property-aware operation mode.

Version 0.5
-----------
	- Updated the slicer configuration UI with more toggle switches.
	- Added support to perform assertion preserving slices.
	- Added support to toggle interference dependence. (feature request #540)
	- Added support to inject calling context into seed criteria.
  	- Added support to perform property-aware (thread locality) context-sensitive slicing.  This extends context injection into seed 
  	  criteria.
	- The user can now specify scope of slicing via a scope specification file.	  
	- Added support to generate criteria based on class-level entities (feature request #232)
	- Provided a new class "FieldBasedCriteriaGenerator" to generated criteria based on fields.
	- Refactored classes related criteria filters, generators, and specification.
    - Addressed feature request #562, #537, and #540.
    - Addressed bug report #558 and #551.
	- A whole lot of bug fixes.
	

Version 0.4
------------
	- Feature requests 397, 411, 427.
	- Class file and Sources are now v1.4 compatible.
	- Slicing is context-sensitive.
	

Version 0.3
------------
	- Bugfixes in executable slice generation phase.
	- Catered to bug reports 389, 390, 408, and 410.
	- Extended the slicer configuration file to store safe lock analysis usage information.  This will invalidate the 
	  configurations from older versions.


Version 0.2
------------
	- All xmlizers use classes from xmlenc library to generate xml documents.
	- Catered to feature/bug requests 370, 371, 373, 376, 378, 379, 384, 385, 386, and 391.
	- Jakarta Commons IO v1.0 is used for common file and i/o operations.
	- Added support to specify slice criteria via command line through a criteria specification file.
	- Added support to serialize/deserialize slice criteria.
	- Forward slicing and Complete slicing is available as we introduced exit control dependence in Indus StaticAnalyses
	  module


Version 0.1
------------
This is (hopefully) a stable release of version 0.1a.  One notable change is that we have decided to use Soot 2.1.0 for
Indus.  This is because there were some changes in Soot pertaining to control flow graphs which were not decided at the time
of this release.  As we do not know when these changes in Soot will stabilize we advice the users to use Soot 2.1.0 only.


Version 0.1a
--------------
This is the first release of Java Slicer subproject of Indus.  This module provides a Java program slicer that is preassembled
as a tool and can be assembled to the liking of the user.  Please refer to the user guid and the java docs for more
information.
