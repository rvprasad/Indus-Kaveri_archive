This package contains the classes that implement the Java program slicer.  The slicer is implemented in two parts.  The first 
part is the detection of the slice.  The second part is the construction of the slice.  The first part depends on dependence 
analyses that are implemented in <i>StaticAnalyses</i> subproject.  The rest of the logic pertaining to these two parts are 
realized by classes in this package.

<p>The above view differs from the classical slicing definition.  The reason for this divergence is that we have 2 
	representations of the slice.  One being an annotation/tag based slice in which the untransformed system is 
	annotated/tagged to indicate the slice. The other being that a new system representing the slice is created from scratch.  
	Given these representations of the slice, slicing is an analysis (detection of the slice) that provides information for a 
	transformation (creation of the slice).
</p>
<p>
	<i>SlicingEngine</i> is the analysis part of the slicer.  <i>CloningBasedSlicingTransformer</i> and 
		<i>TagBasedSlicingTransformer</i> are the transformations that lead to the 2 representation of the slices.  The slicing
		criteria are created via <i>SliceCriteriaFactory</i> and the engine will only accept criteria created via this factory.
