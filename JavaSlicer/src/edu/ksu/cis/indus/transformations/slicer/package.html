This package contains the classes that implement the transformation/residualization part of the Java program slicer.  
<p>
	<i>CloningBasedSlicingTransformer</i> and <i>TaggingBasedSliceResidualizernsformer</i> are the transformations 
	that lead to the 2 representation of the slices. <i>ISliceResidualizer</i> and <i>AbstractSliceResidualizer</i> provide the 
	generic interface to be implemented by such transformers.
