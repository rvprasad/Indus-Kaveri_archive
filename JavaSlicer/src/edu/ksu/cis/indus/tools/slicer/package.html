<p>This package exposes the slicer module in Indus as a tool that can be used in tool chains.  The purpose is to provide a 
	coherent interface to the slicer such that a high level application does not have to deal with low level details of the 
	slicer.</p>
<p>This package also contains classes that can be used to generate XML documents containing information about the 
	slice.</p>
